# GitHub Class Practice Guide

## 1️⃣ Why are we using GitHub?

In today’s lecture, we talked about **digital culture and digital communities**—how online spaces shape collaboration, participation, and visibility.

GitHub is a real-world example of this because:
- It is **collaborative**: many people work in one shared space.
- It makes contribution **visible** (commits, history, timestamps).
- It has **rules and boundaries** that shape how people participate.

We are using GitHub not just as a tool, but as a **digital community with norms**, similar to the platforms we discussed in class.

## 2️⃣ Create your GitHub account

### Step 1: Sign up
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click **Sign up**
3. Choose:
   - A **username** (keep it professional; you may use this later in other courses or jobs)
   - Your email and password
4. Verify your email.

### Step 2: Basic profile setup (optional but recommended)
1. Click your profile picture (top right) → **Settings**
2. Add your name and profile picture (optional)

---

## 3️⃣ Post your GitHub username on Brightspace (Important!)

After creating your GitHub account, you **must share your GitHub username** so you can be added as a collaborator.

### What to do
1. Log in to **Brightspace**
2. Go to our course page
3. Click the **Discussions** tab
4. Find the forum titled: **GitHub Usernames – Class Practice**
5. Create a **new post** with:
   - Your **GitHub username only**  
     (Example: `firstname123`)

### Important rules
- ✅ Make sure your username is spelled **exactly** as it appears on GitHub
- ❌ Do NOT share your email or password
- ❌ Do NOT reply to other students’ posts

Once you post your username:
- I will add you as a **collaborator** to the class repository
- You will then have to check your email, accept my invitaion, and have access to upload files as a collaborator

⚠️ If you do not post your username, you will not have access to the repository.

---

## 4️⃣ Open the class GitHub repository

1. Click the GitHub repository link shared under Week 2 on BrightSpace
2. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub

---

## 5️⃣ Switch to the correct branch

1. At the top left of the repository page, click the **branch dropdown**
2. Select: **`class-practice`**

⚠️ Do NOT work on the `main` branch.

---

## 6️⃣ ## Creating Your Own Folder with a README.md (Mini Hands-on)

### Goal  
You will create a folder **with your name** inside the `class-practice/` folder by creating a `README.md` file inside it.

---

### Step-by-step instructions

1. **Open the class GitHub repository**
   - Make sure you are logged in to GitHub.
   - Open the repository link shared by your instructor.

2. **Switch to the correct branch**
   - Click the branch dropdown at the top left.
   - Select **`class-practice`**.

3. **Open the `class-practice` folder**
   - Click on the folder named **`class-practice/`**.

4. **Create a new file**
   - Click **Add file** → **Create new file**.

5. **Create your folder and README file**
   - In the **filename** box at the top, type:
     ```
     class-practice/firstname-lastname/README.md
     ```
     Example:
     ```
     class-practice/Jane-Doe/README.md
     ```
   - GitHub will automatically create the folder when you create the file.

6. **Add content to your README file**
   - In the text box, paste the followin:
     ```
      ### Academic Integrity & Collaboration Statement
      I confirm that all files uploaded to this folder are my own original work.  
      I will only edit files inside my own folder and will not modify or delete any other folders or files in this repository.

     ```

7. **Commit your changes**
   - Scroll down to **Commit changes**.
   - Add a commit message, for example:
     ```
     Create personal folder with README
     ```
   - Make sure it says **Commit directly to the class-practice branch**.
   - Click **Commit changes**.

### Reminder

> Creating a folder with your name is how GitHub recognizes your space in this shared digital community.

---

## 8️⃣ Important rules for this repository

### ✅ You MAY:
- Upload files to **your own folder**
- Update or replace files **inside your folder**
- Ask questions if you are unsure

### ❌ You must NOT:
- Edit or delete files in other students’ folders
- Upload files outside your folder
- Rename or move folders

Think of GitHub like a shared lab:
- You work freely in your own space
- You do not touch others’ work

---

## 9️⃣ Why this matters (Digital culture connection)

GitHub shows us that:
- Participation is **structured**
- Contributions are **visible and tracked**
- Platforms define what counts as collaboration

This connects directly to our lecture:
- Digital communities are not neutral
- Visibility and contribution are shaped by platforms
- Rules and design affect how people participate

We will return to GitHub later to reflect on it as a **digital culture platform**, not just a storage tool.
