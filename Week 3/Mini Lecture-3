# Week 3 Mini Lecture  
## From Community to Affect: Digital Culture, Emotion, and Identity

---

## Opening: From Week 2 to Week 3

Last week, our focus was on **participation, community, and digital connectivity**.

### Week 2 Required Readings
- Charlie Gere, *Community without Community in Digital Culture* (2011), Chapter 1: **“Digitality”**
- Luke Goode, *Cultural Citizenship Online* (2010)

Together, these readings showed us that:
- Digital platforms **invite participation**
- Participation is **structured and uneven**
- Connectivity does not automatically create **community**
- Visibility and voice are distributed unequally online

Week 3 builds directly on these ideas, but asks a different question:

> **How do digital structures shape how we feel — and how we understand ourselves?**

This week, we move from **community** to **affect and identity**.

---

### ⏸ Pause & Think
- When you are active online, what emotions come up most often?
- Do these feelings feel personal, or do they feel shaped by the platforms you use?

(No need to answer out loud yet — just notice.)

---

## Part 1: Digital Culture as an Affective Environment  
### *Introduction: The Effective Fabric of Digital Culture*

This reading argues that digital culture is not just about content or communication — it is about **emotional environments**.

Digital platforms constantly produce:
- urgency (notifications, alerts, updates)
- anticipation (likes, replies, views)
- disappointment (silence, low engagement)
- comparison (metrics, followers, visibility)

These emotions are not accidental.  
They are part of the **design of digital systems**.

### Example
Think about checking your phone:
- You are not always looking for information
- You are responding to a *feeling*: boredom, anxiety, curiosity, habit

Digital culture works by shaping **how participation feels**, not just what participation is.

---

### Connection to Week 2
Week 2 showed us that platforms **engineer participation**.  
This reading adds that platforms also **engineer emotion**.

Participation is not only about action — it is also about **affect**.

---

### ⏸ Pause & Think
- Which emotions do you associate most with being online?
- Are these emotions momentary, or do they linger throughout your day?

---

## Part 2: The Updating Self   
### *Wendy Hui Kyong Chun — Updating to Remain the Same*

Chun argues that digital culture is obsessed with the future:
- the next update
- the next trend
- the next feature

But she claims that digital media matter most when they stop feeling new and become **habitual**.

We do not just use digital media — we live through routines:
- checking
- refreshing
- scrolling
- updating

Her key formula is:

> **Habit + Crisis = Update**

Platforms create:
- habits (daily routines)
- small crises (security warnings, fear of missing out, “new version available”)

These crises push users to update again and again.

---

### Affect and Identity
This produces a specific emotional condition:
- low-level anxiety
- constant catching up
- pressure to remain visible and responsive

Identity becomes tied to:
- activity
- responsiveness
- being “up to date”

In digital culture, it can feel like:

> **To exist is to be updated.**

---

### Connection to Week 2
Last week we discussed whether platforms create a collective **“we”**.

Chun suggests something different:
- platforms increasingly address **YOU**
- participation is individualized
- responsibility is personalized

Community becomes fragmented into many individual users rather than a shared collective.

---

### ⏸ Pause & Think
- When was the last time you felt stressed about not replying, posting, or updating?
- How would it feel to stop updating for a few days?

---

## Transition to Presentation 1 

So far, we have discussed:
- digital community and participation (Week 2)
- digital affect, habit, and emotional tempo (Week 3)

Now we move to an even more personal question:

> **How do we present ourselves in digital culture?**

This is where **self-representation** becomes central.

Martina will now take these ideas further by presenting  
**Nancy Thumim’s *Self-Representation and Digital Culture***.

As you listen, think about:
- what versions of yourself you present online
- what feels easy to share
- what feels risky or invisible

Her presentation builds directly on the ideas of community, affect, and identity we’ve discussed so far.

## Closing Activity: Digital Affect & Platform Experience 

This activity helps us reflect on **how digital platforms feel**, not just how they function.  
It connects to:
- **Week 2:** participation, community, engineered connectivity  
- **Week 3:** affect, habit, identity, and self-representation

### Part 1 — Emoji-to-Apps (Anonymous Padlet Activity)

👉 Click here to access the board:  
[Padlet board](https://padlet.com/mrazavig/digital-affect-emoji-mapping-aalz0d0g2spwbk1q)

**Instructions:**
1. Look at the app icons posted on the Padlet.
2. Add one **emoji** to the app icon that represent **how the app usually makes you feel**
3. You may add **1–2 words** if you want, but this is optional.

There are **no right or wrong answers**.  
You do **not** need to explain or justify your emojis.

## Part 2 — Identity, Authenticity, and Self-Representation (Anonymous Padlet + Group Discussion)

This discussion builds on this week’s themes of **affect, identity, and self-representation**, and connects directly to the readings and presentations.

### Step 1 — Padlet Response (Individual)

👉 **Access the Padlet board here:**  
[Padlet board](https://padlet.com/mrazavig/how-does-your-online-presence-differ-from-your-in-person-ide-lwlcxhqftl1tf864)

On the Padlet, you will see two positions:

- **Identity Is Curated Online**
- **Identity Remains Authentic**

**Instructions:**
1. Read the two statements on the Padlet.
2. Add a short comment under **one or both** sections:
   - Indicate which position you **agree with more**, **disagree with**, or **feel torn between**.
3. Write 2–3 sentences explaining *why*.

There is no correct answer.  
You may stay general and do not need to share personal details.

---

### Step 2 — Small Group Discussion

After everyone has posted, form small groups and discuss the questions below.

Use your Padlet responses as a starting point, but feel free to expand or change your position as you talk.

**Group Discussion Questions:**

1. Why did you choose the position you commented on?
2. Did anyone in your group choose a different position? What reasons did they give?
3. Do different platforms (e.g. Instagram, GitHub, WhatsApp) encourage different versions of identity?
4. When does self-curation feel empowering, and when does it feel like pressure?
5. Do you experience yourself more as an individual **“YOU”** or part of a collective **“we”** in digital spaces?

---

### Step 3 — Connecting Back to Theory

As you discuss, try to connect your experience to this week’s concepts:

- **Week 2:** engineered connectivity, participation, visibility  
- **Week 3:** affect, habit, self-representation, identity  

Think about:
- how platforms shape *how you feel* online  
- how those feelings influence *how you present yourself*

---

*This activity is about reflection, not judgment.  
You are always free to keep your responses abstract or hypothetical.*

## Key Takeaway from today's topic:

> Digital culture does not just shape how we connect —  
> it shapes how we feel and how we understand ourselves.  
> Community, affect, and identity are deeply interconnected.
